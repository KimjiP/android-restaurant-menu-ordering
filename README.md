Note: this app is for a coursework assignment. It queries a server that is not personally maintained by me. It may not work anymore if the webmaster decides to deactivate this service.

This code includes:

1. Database Setup
2. Button initialization
3. Querying and modifying database entries
4. OnClick and OnLongClick events
5. Using Adapter and RecyclerView

See android-restaurant-menu-ordering/app/src/main/java/com/example/madclassproj/ for the java codes
